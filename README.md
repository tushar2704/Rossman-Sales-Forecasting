The objective of this project is to build a sales forecasting model that predicts future sales for each Rossmann store. By leveraging historical sales data, store-specific information, and external factors like holidays, the model aims to provide reliable sales predictions for upcoming periods. This will help Rossmann allocate resources efficiently, optimize store operations, and maintain customer satisfaction by ensuring the availability of products.

## Project Overview

Rossmann is a well-known drugstore chain with thousands of stores across different regions. The company aims to improve its sales and inventory management by accurately forecasting future sales. Accurate sales forecasting enables the company to optimize inventory, plan promotions effectively, and make informed business decisions.

## Dataset Information:
The dataset for this project consists of two main CSV files:
- 1. data.csv: This file contains historical sales data for various Rossmann stores. It includes information such as the store ID, date, sales, customers, whether the store was open or closed, whether a promotion was running, and various other store-related attributes.
- 2. store.csv: This file provides additional information about each Rossmann store. It includes details like the store ID, store type (a, b, c, d), assortment type (a, b, c), competition distance, whether there is a competitor nearby, whether the store is under promotion (Promo2), and related details.

## Project Scope
- Rossmann aims to gain a competitive edge by enhancing sales forecasting accuracy. Accurate predictions help Rossmann to optimize inventory levels, ensure sufficient stock availability during high-demand periods, and reduce excess inventory costs. Furthermore, the accurate forecast enables the company to plan promotions strategically, resulting in increased footfall and higher sales.

- To achieve this, the project will explore the historical sales data of various Rossmann stores, identify patterns, trends, and seasonality, and leverage this information to build a reliable sales forecasting model. Additionally, external factors such as holidays and competitor activity will be considered to account for their impact on sales.

- By implementing an accurate sales forecasting model, Rossmann can make data-driven decisions, improve resource allocation, and optimize store performance to achieve higher profitability and customer satisfaction.
